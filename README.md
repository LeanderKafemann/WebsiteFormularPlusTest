# WebsiteFormularPlusTest

a website dynamically server-side generating input fields<br/><br/>

I modernized this code using my PyWSGIRef module to decrease complexity and increase readability.<br/><br/>

Note that this is a test application and thus should be reviewed before using it in production.<br/><br/>

Work is finished and the test is successful.<br/><br/>

No further work is planned for this project.<br/><br/>

Thanks for your support!
